# Black-Friday-Sales-Prediction
Predict the purchase amount of customer against various products which will help them to create personalized offer for customers against different products.

The Black Friday Sales dataset is used for training various machine learning models and also for predicting the purchase amount of customers on black friday sales [. The purchase prediction made will provide an insight to retailers to analyze and personalize offers for more customer's preferred products.

## Details
The dataset here is a sample of the transactions made in a retail store.

The store wants to know better the customer purchase behaviour against different products.

Specifically, here the problem is a regression problem where we are trying to predict the dependent variable (the amount of purchase) with the help of the information contained in the other variables.

There are seven categorical variables to analyse.

## INTRODUCTION

The shopping sector has greatly evolved due to the Internet revolution. Most of the population takes into consideration online shopping more than the traditional method of shopping. The biggest perks of online shopping are convenience, better prices, more variety, easy price comparisons, no crowds, etc. The pandemic has boosted online shopping.

This day is marked as the busiest day in terms of shopping. The purpose of organizing this sale is to promote customers to buy more products online to boost the online shopping sector.

The prediction model built will help to analyze the relationship among various attributes. Black Friday Sales

Dataset is used for training and prediction. Black Friday Sales Dataset is the online biggest dataset and the dataset is also accepted by various e-commerce websites .

The prediction model built will provide a prediction based on the age of the customer, city category, occupation, etc. The prediction model is implemented based on models like linear regression, ridge regression, lasso regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor.

The paper further walks through various sections. Section I gives an introduction to the problem, section II illustrates the prior research done in this field, section III provides the data set description, section IV presents the proposed model, with the conclusion in the last section.
